# Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project provides two different keylogger implementations:
1. Workspace Keylogger (using pynput) - Logs keystrokes only in the current workspace
2. System Keylogger (using keyboard) - Logs system-wide keystrokes

## Features
### Workspace Keylogger (pynput_logger.py)
- Captures keystrokes only in the current workspace
- No elevated permissions required
- Cross-platform compatible
- Logs to `workspace_keylog.txt`

### System Keylogger (system_logger.py)
- Captures system-wide keystrokes
- Requires elevated permissions
- Logs to `system_keylog.txt`

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- For workspace logging: `pynput` library
- For system-wide logging: `keyboard` library

### Installation
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pynput   # For workspace logging
pip install keyboard # For system-wide logging
```

### Running the Scripts

#### 1. Workspace Keylogger (pynput_logger.py)
No special permissions required on any OS:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
python3 pynput_logger.py

# Windows
python pynput_logger.py
```

#### 2. System Keylogger (system_logger.py)

##### Linux
Requires sudo privileges:
1. First install keyboard module with sudo:
```bash
sudo pip3 install keyboard
```
2. Run the script with sudo:
```bash
sudo python3 system_logger.py
```

##### Windows
Requires Administrator privileges:
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
   - Right-click Command Prompt
   - Select "Run as Administrator"
2. Navigate to script directory:
```cmd
cd path\to\script
```
3. Run the script:
```cmd
python system_logger.py
```

##### macOS
Due to system security restrictions:
1. Need to grant Accessibility permissions:
   - System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
   - Add Terminal or your Python IDE to allowed apps
2. Run with sudo:
```bash
sudo python3 system_logger.py
```

Note: System-wide logging may still be limited on macOS due to security measures.

## Installation Troubleshooting

### Linux
If you get "No module named 'keyboard'" when using sudo:
```bash
sudo -H pip3 install keyboard
```

### Windows
If you get permission errors:
1. Try installing keyboard module as admin:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Run: `pip install keyboard`
2. Check Windows Defender settings
3. Temporarily disable antivirus (if needed)

### macOS
If keyboard module doesn't work:
1. Try reinstalling with sudo:
```bash
sudo pip3 install --force-reinstall keyboard
```
2. Check Terminal has Accessibility permissions

## Security Notice
⚠️ IMPORTANT: These tools should only be used:
- On your own devices
- With explicit permission
- For educational/testing purposes
- In compliance with local laws and regulations

## Limitations
- Workspace Logger (pynput):
  - Only logs keystrokes in the current workspace
  - More limited in scope but requires no special permissions
  
- System Logger (keyboard):
  - Requires elevated permissions
  - May be blocked by security software
  - Not fully functional on macOS

## Files Included
1. `pynput_logger.py` - Workspace-specific keylogger
2. `system_logger.py` - System-wide keylogger
3. `workspace_keylog.txt` - Log file for workspace keystrokes
4. `system_keylog.txt` - Log file for system-wide keystrokes

## Exit Instructions
- Workspace Logger: Press 'Esc' to stop
- System Logger: Press 'Esc' to stop


## New Features ADDED : 
- MOUSE CLICK Logging along with the co-ordinates of the mouse pointer
- Active Window tracking
